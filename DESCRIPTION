Description: S4 classes and methods
    to deal with fuzzy numbers. They allow for computing any arithmetic
    operations (e.g., by using the Zadeh extension principle),
    performing approximation of arbitrary FNs by trapezoidal and piecewise
    linear FNs, preparing plots of FNs for publications, computing
    possibility and necessity values for comparisons, etc.
