Description: S4 classes and methods
    to deal with fuzzy numbers. They allow for computing any arithmetic
    operations (e.g., by using the Zadeh extension principle),
    performing approximation of arbitrary fuzzy numbers by trapezoidal
    and piecewise linear ones, preparing plots for publications, computing
    possibility and necessity values for comparisons, etc.
